Opus is a general-purpose utility mod, with a focus on practicality.
It is easy to use alongside your mod, only has one dependency, and has optimization options in the configuration.

Opus is composed of these core components:
- Opus, which contains most of the useful methods you can call.
- OpusColor, which contains useful colors not provided by the XNA framework, as well as cycling gradients.
- OpusAssets, which is a repository of textures to be used during draw call, as well as a few sound effects. It is currently limited to the basics, such as glow and sparkles.
- OpusBook, a Localization-Based book system that allows you to register books page-by-page and read through them with an in-game UI.
