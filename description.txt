Opus is a general-purpose utility mod, with a focus on practicality.
It is easy to use alongside your mod, only has one dependency, and has optimization options in the configuration.

Opus is composed of these core components:
- Opus, which contains most of the useful methods you can call.
- OpusColorUtils, which has a helper method for getting a color with an alpha.
- OpusBook, a book system that allows you to register books page-by-page and read through them with an in-game UI. Supports localized text, but is finnecky in that case.
